<h1 id="servermodmanager">ServerModManager</h1>
<p>A package manager for SCP: Secret Laboratory</p>
<p>SeverModManager is designed to make installing <a href="https://github.com/Grover-c13/Smod2">SMod2</a> packages easier. It’s modeled after pip, so if you have worked with that, you’re good to go.</p>
<p>Install by simply running <code>scpman install packagename</code>, and remove with <code>scpman remove packagename</code>. Simple!</p>
<p>Dependencies are automatically taken care of, so you don’t have to install everything one at a time.</p>
<p>Uses .NET Core, so it can be run on Windows and Linux (and maybe even OS X…)</p>
