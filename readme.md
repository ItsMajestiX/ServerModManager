<h1 id="servermodmanager">ServerModManager</h1>
<p>A package manager for SCP: Secret Laboratory</p>
<p>SeverModManager is designed to make installing <a href="https://github.com/Grover-c13/Smod2">SMod2</a> packages easier. It’s modeled after pip, so if you have worked with that, you’re good to go.</p>
<p>Install by simply running <code>scpman install packagename</code>, and remove with <code>scpman remove packagename</code>. Simple!</p>
<p>Dependencies are automatically taken care of, so you don’t have to install everything one at a time.</p>
<p>Uses .NET Core, so it can be run on Windows and Linux (and maybe even OS X…)</p>
<h1 id="install">Install</h1>
<p>Create a new folder at the same level as sm_plugins and unzip the files there. Now you’re good to go!</p>
<h1 id="note-on-json">Note on JSON</h1>
<p>The JSON format will change a lot, so it’s a good idea to get every new release. I’ll freeze the format in v1.0, but untill then, things are subject to change without warning.</p>
<h1 id="to-do">To Do</h1>
<ul>
<li>Framework Dependant Executable to remove the need for all those pesky extra DLLs (most likely coming with .NET Core 3.0 and VS 2019, so hopefully soon)</li>
<li>Don’t dump stack trace</li>
<li>Update  command</li>
<li>Futureproof JSON</li>
</ul>
<p>Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/VirtualBrightPlayz">VirtualBrightPlayz</a> for making the packing I tested on in the begining: <a href="https://github.com/VirtualBrightPlayz/Smod2-Mod1_DCLASS_MADNESS">dclassmadneess</a></p>
